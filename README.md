## TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a new repository under rolasnajera using this template.
1. **Title:** Change the first line of this README to the name of your project, and replace the computer with an
emoji that represents your project. 
1. **Badges:** In the badges section above, change the repo name in each URL. If you are creating something other
than a Rust crate, remove the crates.io and docs badges (and feel free to add more appropriate ones for your language).
1. **CI:** In `./github/workflows/` rename `rust-ci.yml` (or the appropriate config for your language) to `ci.yml`.
And go over it and adapt it to work for your project
   - If you aren't using or customized the CI workflow, also see the TODO in `.mergify.yml`
   - If you want to use the automatic rustdoc publishing to github pages for git main, see `rustdoc-pages.yml`
1. **Issue & PR Templates**: Review the files in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `.github/pull_request_template`. Adapt them
   to suit your needs, removing or re-wording any sections that don't make sense for your use case.
1. **CHANGELOG.md:** Change the `$REPO_NAME` in the links at the bottom to the name of the repository, and replace the
example template lines with the actual notes for the repository/crate.
1. **release.toml:** in `./release.toml` change the `$REPO_NAME` to the name of the repository
1. **Cleanup:** Remove this section of the README and any unused files (such as configs for other languages) from the repo.
1. **.gitignore** The initial template contains general gitignore file, be mindfull to add yours.
